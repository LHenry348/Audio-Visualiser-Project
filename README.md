# Description of the project
An Undertale themed project, where the bones move as a visualiser, and the soul in the middle pulses in time with the music.

# Instructions for use
Press SPACE at any time to pause the music.

# How it works
The bones use push and pop matrix functions, as well as translate functions, to move up and down in reaction to the music. The heart's size is controlled by a variable connected to a lerp function, which makes it grow larger and smaller depending on how the music sounds.

# What we are most proud of in this assignment
The elements that made us the most proud were how the bones and the heart react to the music. Both of these parts took a long time to get functioning, and once we figured them out, they looked great. The visual design of the project overall was worked hard on, and we think it's something to be proud of.
